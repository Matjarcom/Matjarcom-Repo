We will have e-commercial page to sale children related items  (cloths, toys accessories), It will be a place that the buyers will find all of the children requirements, that sorted based on ages, gender and brands, with details for each product. We want to allow them to choose the details of their product. We let them have their items in their cart. Also, our page will have image map that clarify the locations of our branches.
